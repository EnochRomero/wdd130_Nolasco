        <p id="one">MEXICAN FOOD IS THE BEST
            If there's one thing that defines Mexican food, it's its 
            incredible variety of flavors and textures. From the heat of 
            the chilies to the smoothness of melted cheese, every dish 
            has its own personality. The recipes you'll find here are not 
            only delicious but also easy to make. </p>
            <p id="two"> TACOS THE UNDISPUTED CHAMPIONS Tacos are the heart and soul of Mexican cuisine. They 
                come in all forms: al pastor, carnitas, barbacoa, suadero... 
                If you don't like tacos, you might need to rethink your life 
                choices. 
                </p>
            <p id="three"> MEXICAN FOOD BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER
                 Whether you're at a taco stand in Mexico City or having a 
                family dinner in Idaho, Mexican food has the power to bring 
                people together. Cooking and sharing these dishes with 
                others is one of the most rewarding experiences. 
                </p>
            <p id="four">WHY MAKE SOMETHING ELSE You could cook any type of food, but none will be as 
                satisfying as Mexican food. With its vibrant colors, 
                irresistible aromas, and mix of flavors, there's simply no 
                competition.
